**2015.11, Dynamic detail population for massive scene rendering.** Ogre / C++
* Done in a hackathon (within 48 hours)  
* It's a massive LOD system, populates millions of procedural details based on current view. Can be easily modified by artists.  
* In the demo, I showed a grassland, free from bird-view to a close view that shows "cell"s on a single grass-blade.
* I entered MSRA by this.

**2016.4, Realistic Procedural Generation & Rendering for Trees.** Unity
* Fractal based, totally random procedural, realistic tree & growth animation  
* Day-night cycle based on atmosphere scattering (referenced to related paper)  
* Several tricks to make the graphics better

* An indie fantastic 3D RPG game
* Terrain and graphics
* *Disclaimer: Assets bought from asset store*
    * Houses and assets in the village

### Games or related

**2011, 2013 ~ 2014, 2014 ~ 2016 Minecraft-liked Game.** Ogre / C++
* A voxel-based game (like minecraft)
* Use Octrees to optimize the scene
* It was mainly done in my highschool so it is not good though

**2015, Touchann Project.** C++
* A 2D Shooting Game similar to touhou project and arcade shooting games.
* Touchann is one of my friends (

**2016, Ball-Bouncing Game.** Unity (Mobile)
* My first attempt to Unity
* A Mobile game, a ball will bounce when hitting user drawn lines.
* Control the ball hit bouns items, or it will die after several bounces.
* Special item makes splitting a ball to two balls.

**2016.7, Vulkan rendering framework.** Vulkan / C++
* I made this for learning Vulkan (a new Graphics API).
* It is very simple.
* https://github.com/linkzeldagg/vulkanVoxelTest

**2017, "User define" magical spell generator.** Unity

* User can enter a custom string (sort of program) to create custom spells

**2017.11, Voxel engine for massive scene with LOD.** OpenGL

* Dynamically generated meshes using GPU computing
* LOD makes rendering distance further (around 5km^2, 1m = 1voxel, without noticeable lagging, chunk data changes every frame)

**2018, miniRAID.** WebGL (melon.js)
* a web 2D RPG game, in progress. 
* modified low-level rendering logic of melon.js.

**2015 ~ 2018, Gatcha simulators** Adobe Flash / Unity
* Simulates the visual effect of Gatcha in popular mobile games
* Flash: スクフェス、艦これ（建造）、あんスタ
* Unity: 恋プロ、FGO
* Used for prize winning (lottery) program in anime & comic club annual ceremony show
* (relatively) High quality
* There are playable demos but it might not be legal to show it...

### Machine Learning and miscellaneous

**2016, Shape Reconigition** C# / DirectDraw
* Based on shape context (referenced to related paper)
* Actually I want make a game, where player could draw their desired weapons.

* So many...
* Done in my lab at Tokyo Tech.
